When the 2020 COVID19 Pandemic hit, Unity gave their [learn.unity.com](https://learn.unity.com) courses away for free in perpetuity.

What better time to pick up a new skill in programming than to take on the Junior Programmer path way and start my beginnings. This also plays well
with the "Haha Game Dev Go Brrr" project.
