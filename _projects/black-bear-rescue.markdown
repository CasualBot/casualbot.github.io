Manitoba Black Bear Rescue is a not-for-profit charity organization based in Stonewall that helps rescue and rehabilitate either abandonned or orphaned black bear cubs.

It is a closed compound to prevent the bears from becoming comfortable around humans so I have provided them my tech expertise to help provide 
social media, SEO, and web technology knowledge and guidance in kind of cash donation.
