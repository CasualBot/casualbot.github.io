### About
As part of my want to learn more about Game Dev a few peers and myself have picked up the Pragmatic Progammers copy of Hands-on Rust.


### Chapter 1 & Chapter 2 - Set up and Getting to know Rust
It feels a lot like GoLang but nicer! 

### Chapter 3 - Flappy Dragon
Flappy bird may be gone but wow did it give us a new "Hello World" game dev equivalent!
